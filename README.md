# OSIS SMAN 3 Bandung Website
This repository contains templates and projects from our website. We use Blogger as our "hosting service" while it is actually a blog-publishing service. We choose Blogger because we have to save our funds also for easy and fast solution for making websites although we have to develop template with XML format.

For the domain hosting we use a service from [Rumahweb Indonesia](http://www.rumahweb.com "Rumahweb Indonesia").
